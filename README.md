Modal Theory (MT)
A Geometrically Constrained Flat-Space Scalar Framework

Modal Theory is a two–real-scalar field theory formulated in flat Minkowski space. It derives key Standard Model and cosmological observables from a Z₃ orbifold on the phase circle followed by decoherence to a unique 255° vacuum lock.

Core Principle

From a single phase geometry emerge:

Three fermion generations (exact, discrete)

Fine-structure constant (algebraic backbone with geometric dressing)

Fermion mass hierarchies (relic overlaps and geometric seesaw)

Gravity as scalar coherence strain (no curvature)

Dark sector as relic vacuum torque (no particles)

All structure follows from geometry under explicit conventions.

Key Features

No Higgs mechanism — masses from relic overlaps and geometric seesaw

No dark matter particles — dark effects from vacuum torque asymmetry

No spacetime curvature — gravity emerges as coherence strain

Zero free parameters under stated normalization conventions

Falsifiable predictions including:

Laboratory thrust

Phase-harmonic sidebands

Coherence-enhanced material anomalies

Current Status (Modal Theory v10 — January 2026)

Version 10 refines v9’s complete geometric closure into an audit-ready, reproducible formulation with explicit conventions and sensitivity accounting.

Key refinements include:

Orbifold cutoff: Λ_orb = 3 / (2π)

Hierarchy factor ξ_hier derived from cumulative overlap suppression

Chiral bias κ ≈ 0.05 fixed by CP/Jarlskog matching

Nearest-neighbour off-diagonal overlaps O_ij ≈ 0.64 from exact orbifold-domain plus image integrals

Explicit sensitivity analysis for stability of α⁻¹

Quantitative refinement is ongoing: ratios lie in characteristic geometric ranges, with full PDG-level precision the target.
