# Modal Theory (MT)

**A Geometrically Constrained Flat-Space Scalar Framework**

Modal Theory is a two-real-scalar field theory in flat Minkowski space, deriving key Standard Model observables from a Z₃ orbifold on the phase circle and decoherence to a unique 255° vacuum lock.

**Core Principle**  
From one phase geometry: three generations exact, fine-structure constant algebraic, fermion hierarchies geometric, gravity scalar strain, dark sector relic torque.

**Key Features**  
- No Higgs mechanism — masses from relic overlaps/seesaw  
- No dark matter particles — torque from vacuum asymmetry  
- No spacetime curvature — gravity as coherence strain  
- Zero free parameters under explicit conventions  
- Testable predictions: laboratory thrust, sidebands, material anomalies  

**Current Status (v10 – January 15, 2026)**  
v10 refines v9's geometric closure with explicit reproducibility:  
- Λ_orb = 3/(2π) (sector spacing on unit circle)  
- ξ_hier derived from cumulative overlap suppression  
- κ ≈0.05 from CP Jarlskog match  
- Off-diagonal overlaps ~0.64 (orbifold domain + images integral)  
- Sensitivity analysis for α⁻¹ stability  

Quantitative refinements ongoing—ratios in characteristic geometric range, full PDG precision in progress.

**Lab Tests Pending**  
Predictions require experimental validation—no guarantees. Home/kitchen proxies in progress (graphite foil thrust, CEA-255™ strength).
