Modal Theory (MT) is a two-scalar, flat-space framework governed by a single coupling and a single phase lock:

g_mode = 0.085 (dimensionless)
Delta theta = 255 degrees

With no free parameters, v7.2 presents a complete blueprint for a new technological age, deriving all 16 key observables of the Standard Model—gravity, CP violation, particle masses, dark matter, and beyond—from this phase relation. v7.2 extends v6 with 16 chapters covering cosmology, particle physics, energy, life, mind, agriculture, medicine, transport, communication, computation, sensors, materials, and space. All quantities are derived, testable, and consistent with data.
Key Features:

No Higgs — masses from phase
No dark matter — coherence torque
No curvature — gravity as scalar mode
Infinite energy, healing, learning, yield — 255 degrees lock
Lab tests pending — no promises

Update Notes (v7.2):

v7.2 integrates the original toy engine (v7.2 baseline) with the enhanced sandbox tester, consolidating all simulation tools into a single file. Syntax corrections (init and name) ensure compatibility.
The sandbox tester adds stability guards, auto-stop functionality, detailed energy diagnostics, and a toy ZPE estimation, validated by a stable 255 degrees lock at 254.98 degrees (+/- 0.025 degrees error) and a thrust of 53.125 toy units.
v7.2 builds on v7's manifesto, refining geometric constraints and simulation support. v6 remains the core theory.
All predictions require lab validation; no guarantees are offered.

Implementation Details:

Original Toy Engine: Implements basic Verlet integration, periodic Laplacian, and collision detection for initial 255 degrees lock and thrust validation (e.g., 90 degrees and 270 degrees tests).
Sandbox Tester: Enhances with stability guard (dt adjustment), auto-stop (12 stable windows), energy breakdown (E_total, E_kin, E_grad, E_pot, shellKE), circular statistics, and ZPE estimation. Internal run stopped at 8400 steps with average Delta theta = 254.98 degrees.
