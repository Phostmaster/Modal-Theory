Modal Theory (MT) is a two-scalar, flat-space framework governed by a single coupling and a single phase lock:
g_mode = 0.085 (dimensionless), Δθ = 255°
With no free parameters, v7 presents a complete blueprint for a new technological age, deriving all 16 key observables of the Standard Model—gravity, CP violation, particle masses, dark matter, and beyond—from this phase relation.
v7 extends v6 with 16 chapters covering cosmology, particle physics, energy, life, mind, agriculture, medicine, transport, communication, computation, sensors, materials, and space. All quantities are derived, testable, and consistent with data.
Key Features:

No Higgs — masses from phase
No dark matter — coherence torque
No curvature — gravity as scalar mode
Infinite energy, healing, learning, yield — 255° lock
Lab tests pending — no promises

Update Notes (v7):
v7 is the manifesto for the 255° technological revolution. All predictions require lab validation. v6 remains the core theory.
